########### Introduction ###########

TCR data downloaded from the IMGT reference sequence database (http://www.imgt.org/vquest/refseqh.html)
Nucleotide (nt) and aminoacid (aa) data  with (gap) and without (nogap) IMGT alignment gaps have been downloaded in the associated folders.


########### Anchor positions #######

Anchor positions are positions which delimit the CDR-IMGT and which belong to the neighbouring FR-IMGT. They are shown in squares in the IMGT Colliers de Perles (IMGT Repertoire). Anchor positions are:

    26 and 39 for the CDR1-IMGT
    55 and 66 for the CDR2-IMGT
    104 and 118 for the CDR3-IMGT


########## Correspondence between numberings for CDR of different lengths (horizontal display) are given at the following link:
