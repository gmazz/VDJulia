########### Introduction

TCR data downloaded from the IMGT reference sequence database (http://www.imgt.org/vquest/refseqh.html)
Nucleotide (nt) and aminoacid (aa) data  with (gap) and without (nogap) IMGT alignment gaps have been downloaded in the associated folders.


###########  IMGT FASTA header of nucleotide IMGT reference sequences

The IMGT FASTA header of nucleotide IMGT  reference sequences contains 15 fields separated by '|':
1. IMGT/LIGM-DB accession number(s)
2. IMGT gene and allele name
3. species
4. IMGT allele functionality
5. exon(s), region name(s), or extracted label(s)
6. start and end positions in the IMGT/LIGM-DB accession number(s)
7. number of nucleotides in the IMGT/LIGM-DB accession number(s)
8. codon start, or 'NR' (not relevant) for non coding labels
9. +n: number of nucleotides (nt) added in 5' compared to the corresponding label extracted from IMGT/LIGM-DB
10. +n or -n: number of nucleotides (nt) added or removed in 3' compared to the corresponding label extracted from IMGT/LIGM-DB
11. +n, -n, and/or nS: number of added, deleted, and/or substituted nucleotides to correct sequencing errors, or 'not corrected' if non corrected sequencing errors
12. number of amino acids (AA): this field indicates that the sequence is in amino acids
13. number of characters in the sequence: nt (or AA)+IMGT gaps=total
14. partial (if it is)
15. reverse complementary (if it is)


############ Anchor positions

Anchor positions are positions which delimit the CDR-IMGT and which belong to the neighbouring FR-IMGT. They are shown in squares in the IMGT Colliers de Perles (IMGT Repertoire). Anchor positions are:

    26 and 39 for the CDR1-IMGT
    55 and 66 for the CDR2-IMGT
    104 and 118 for the CDR3-IMGT


############ CDR correspondence and numbering 

Correspondence between numberings for CDR of different lengths (horizontal display) are given at the following link:
